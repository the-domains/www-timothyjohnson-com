drivingthroughtheflyoverstates

i pretty much never start out writing a piece about anything. i usually start out by trying to pick out something i heard in my head - but i always think sounds different than when i actually start to play it. so it took me a long time to understand that i am hearing a "conceptual" sound in my head and, while it has an equivalent in the audible world, it is sometime surprising how "different" it sound aloud. once the piece starts to take shape, i begin to associate feeling and/or memories with the emotional terrain and that, in turn, influences the performance.

when i was a in my teens, we lived in southern california. every year or so we would go to visit relatives in south carolina traveling by car. we would pick a different route for each way and, as a result, got to see a lot of the country.

this piece reminded me of getting up early, getting in the car, staring out the window as we found our way. passing natural wonders, mountains, wasteland, cornfields, shanty, brilliant, staring, dreaming.
